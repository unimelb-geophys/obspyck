<center><h2>Input conventions and format <br>for <i>focmec</i> and <i>focplt</i></h2></center>

<p>
This is a description of the input format of polarities and ratios for program <i>focmec</i> (done in 
subroutine <i>focinp</i>) for determining acceptable focal mechanisms.  The same input is used in program <i>focplt</i> (through 
subroutine <i>prplot</i>) for displaying graphically first motions and/or ratios, fault planes, and nodal surfaces.</p>
<pre>
        READ(1,'(A)') COMMNT			!  First line input file
200     READ(1,5,END=300,ERR=500) STA,AZIN,TOANG,SENSE,
     .    RATLOG,SVSH2,STOANG,INFO
5       FORMAT(A4,2F8.2,A1,F8.4,1X,A1,1X,F6.2,1X,A) 

STA is a name for the station.  Up to four characters. Not used.
AZIN is the station azimuth (degrees) measured from the epicenter
TOANG is the takeoff angle (degrees) of S for S polarity. Otherwise
     the takeoff angle of P.  TOANG measured relative to down
SENSE is a one-character key for polarity or ratios 

Virginia Tech Symbol conventions:
  C = compression at station (plotted as a hexagon symbol number NS = 1)
  U = same as C (up on vertical)
  D = dilatation --- down on vertical (plotted as a triangle NS=2)
  + = emergent compression  (NS=3) (optionally included in Focmec)
  - = emergent dilatation  (optionally included in Focmec
  e = emergent P arrival  
  > = SH first motion to right (back to event, facing station) impulsive
  < = SH first motion to left (back to event, facing station) impulsive
  L = same as <
  R = same as > (Note: earlier versions used R for SV/P ratio)
  F = SV first motion away from event impulsive
  B = SV first motion towards event impulsive
    The SH and SV first motions are plotted as oriented arrows (NS=6)
  l = SH first motion to left (back to event) emergent
  r = SH first motion to right (back to event) emergent
  u = emergent SH arrival
  V = Log10(SV/P)  (NS=4) (plotted as an X)
  H = Log10(SH/P)  (NS=4) (plotted as an X)
  S = Log10(SV/SH) (NS=4) (plotted as an X)
If one wants to have errors marked, follow the polarity or ratio with a 
  duplicate line with a E in the symbol position.  The error will then be 
  flagged as a square superimposed on the polarity or ratio.
  </pre>
  <p>
  No terminator line is needed.    MAX in FOCMEC.INC is the maximum number
  of alowed ratios plus polarities.</p><p>
If SENSE is R, V, or H:</p>
<ul>
<li>  RATLOG is the log10 (S/P)</li>
<li>  SVSH2 is the polarity of SV or SH.  Not used, but is shown in the
    listing file along with the calculated values.  Convention used
    for the calculated ones are L and R for SH, B and F for SV</li>
<li>  STOANG is the S takeoff angle -- must be entered explicitly if V
    or H are used.  If R is used, assumed the same as PTOANG</li>
<li>  INFO is a field of up to 20 characters.  If the input file were
    prepared by <i>focmec_prep</i>, it would tell the numerator and denominator
    in the amplitude ratio.  (See <i>./sample_runs/sakhalin/</i> for a worked-out example.)</li>
