<h2 align="center">Graphics in the <i>FOCMEC</i> package</h2>
Program <i>Focplt</i> produces plots of focal-sphere projections of data and/or fault-plane solutions using the SAC Graphics Format (SGF) to produce disk files.  Program <i>sgftops</i> converts .sgf files to postscript files.  The <i>FOCMEC</i> package can be compiled and run on &ldquo;big-endian&rdquo; systems (Sun Solaris, Mac OSX PPC) or &ldquo;little-dndian&rdquo; systems (Lynux, Mac OSX i686/intel) that have the opposite byte order for binary data.  Because a .sgf file is a binary file, program <i>sgftops</i> will only work on a .sgf file that has one byte order.  If there is a byte-order mismatch, <i>sgftops</i> will exit with the message that one should run program <i>sgfswap</i> on the file.  Program <i>sgfswap</i> is provided with the package.

Also included are four (Unix .csh) scripts:

<ol>
<li> <i>plsgf</i>: produces a print of a .sgf file.
<li> <i>sgftox</i>: Displays a .sgf plot on the screen.  As written, the script uses program <i>gs</i> (<i>ghostscript</i>), but one can substitute a different postscript-file display program.
<li> <i>sgftoeps</i>: produces a EPS file (Encapsulated Postscript file) from a .sgf file.  Program <i>gs</i> is required.
<li> <i>sgftopdf</i>: produces a PDF file from a .sgf file. Program <i>gs</i> and the Perl script <i>epstopdf</i> are required.
</ol>

<p>To find out more the programs or scripts, enter the name with no arguments. 

<p>Several scripts in Section IV run program <i>Focplt</i> to produce SGF files.  Note that those for the Sakhalin Island event superimpose sets of solutions, so studying them may be helpful regarding how one answers the prompts for adding additional solutions.  The screen output for these scripts is ported into a file named <i>a.junk</i> in the same directory, so if the script exits with an error message, comparing the contents of that file with the calling script should help the user find the error.  

<p>If one wants to test the plotting capabilities without doing a <i>Focplt</i> run, one might want to run program <i>vwbeetle</i> using the script <i>run_vwbeetle</i> (run from the <i>./tests</i>).  As written, it produces the outline of a VW beetle in a .sgf file, and then displays the plot on the screen and finally converts the SGF file into a PDF file.

<p>  In program <i>Focplt</i>, there is a prompt for adding labels to plots.  If one wishes to add a label that is more complicated than letters and numbers, it might be helpful to learn more about the <i>symbol</i> subroutine called by program <i>Focplt</i>.  Script <i>./tests/run\_symdemo</i> produces a screen display and PDF file that shows the capabilities of the symbol subroutine.  <a href="./symbol.html">This file has more information about the Symbol routine.</a>
