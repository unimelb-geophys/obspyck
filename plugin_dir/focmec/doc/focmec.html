<p>
This package contains software for determining and displaying
double-couple earthquake focal mechanisms. Input are polarities (P, SV , SH)
and/or amplitude ratios (SV/P, SH/P, SV/SH). The main program, <i>Focmec</i> (coded in
Fortran 77), performs an efficient, systematic search of the focal sphere and
reports acceptable solutions based on selection criteria for the number of
polarity errors and errors in amplitude ratios. The search of the focal
sphere is uniform in angle, with selectable step size and bounds. The
selection criteria for both polarities and amplitudes allow adjustment through
weightings for near-nodal solutions. Published applications include determinations of
best-constrained fault-plane solutions for suites of earthquakes recorded at
local to regional distances, analysis of large earthquakes observed at
teleseismic distances, and the use of recorded polarities and relative amplitudes
to produce waveform synthetics.

<p>
All paths in this documentation are defined relative to the directory <i>./focmec</i>, which is created by uncompressing and expanding the tarball <i>focmec.tgz</i>.  This file is accordingly <i>./doc/focmec.html</i>.  The FOCMEC manual is <a href="./focmec_manual.pdf"><i>./doc/focmec_manual.pdf</i></a>.  (For active links to work, one must have opened this file from directory ./doc.)

<p>
To build the libraries, tables, and executables, it should suffice to go to <i>./src</i> and (in a Unix system that includes the <i>csh</i> shell) enter <i>build_package</i>. The script is set to use the <i>gfortran</i> compiler, so if you are using a different compiler, you have to edit the first few lines so that it defines <i>FCMP</i> appropriately. If the script runs with no errors, the last thing shown on the screen is a compile/link line for program <i>vwbeetle</i> (a test program for the graphics package). Executables and graphics scripts <i>sgfxxx</i> will be in directory <i>./bin</i>. Scripts for testing parts of the package are in <i>./tests</i>.  To delete all executables and libraries, cd to <i>./src</i> and enter &ldquo;make clean&rdquo; (without the quotes).  See the manual and/or the documentation listed below for more details.
