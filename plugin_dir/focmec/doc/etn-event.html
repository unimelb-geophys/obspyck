<h2 align="center">FOCMEC applied to a data set of <i>P</i>-wave polarities</h2>
<p>
This page supplements the discussion in section IV A of the <a href="./focmec_manual.pdf">FOCMEC manual</a>: the application of the <i>FOCMEC</i> package to find the focal mechanism for a magnitude 4.2
event using <i>P</i> waves recorded by 37 local-to-regional-distance stations. 
Directory <i>./sample_runs/ETNEvent</i> includes a README file,  drivers, and input files for the analysis.  Copies of output files are in directory <i>./doc/ETNEvent-doc/M/i></p>

<p>
The driver files for programs <i>Focmec</i> and <i>Focplt</i> are Unix csh scripts that include
comments.  The programs can be run interactively without using scripts, but using the scripts allows
quick editing to fine-tune runs.  For <i>Focmec</i>, the first run was done
with eight unity-weighted polarity errors.  An examination of the output file indicated that
four was the minimum that could give a well-constrained solution.</p>

<p>As with the sample runs for the Sakhalin-Island event, the <i>Focplt</i> driver scripts as written end with call to produce first a screen display of the plot and then to convert the SGF plot file to a PDF file.  See Appendix D in the manual for more details on graphics in the <i>FOCMEC</i> package.</p>  

<p>
Prior to March, 2002,  program <i>Focmec</i> input code allowed one to enter + and - for
emergent polarities (compression and dilatation respectively), but it did not
use them as data.  (However, they could be plotted in program <i>Focplt</i>, if the user so chose.)  A
user suggested there be an option for them to be used in program <i>Focmec</i>.  Accordingly, if any &ldquo;SENSE&rdquo; is
+ or -, the user will be prompted to choose if emergent polarity picks
should be used or ignored.  To demonstrate this, a set of files has been
added: an input data file in which three of the P picks have been changed from &ldquo;C&rdquo;
to &ldquo;+&rdquo; plus two driver files for the two
options. The new files all have &ldquo;emergence&rdquo; in their filespecs. </p>
