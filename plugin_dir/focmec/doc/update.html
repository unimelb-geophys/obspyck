<h2 align="center">FOCMEC: Update History</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of this software package could be built and run on
IBM/CMS, PDP/RSX, VAX/VMS, Sun snuos, and Windows 98.  The current version runs on Sun Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X (PPC and i686).  The programs are written in Fortran 77 and compile successfully using gfortran, g77, and Sun's f77.   Two programs written in C (gcc) transform graphics plot files from the Sac Graphics Format (SGF) to postscript (<i>sgftops</i>) and swap the byte order of the binary SGF files (<i>sgfswap</i>).  Unix scripts (csh) are included for displaying plots on the screen and for converting plot files from postscript to EPS or PDF.  The plot-conversion scripts require the external program <i>ghostscript</i>.    If the user has or prefers a different postscript viewer for displaying plots, it is easy to modify the plot-display script.  Except for these plot-conversion scripts, X-Windows capability is not required by the <i>FOCMEC</i> package.
<pre>
June 2009: Program sgftops has been updated, but in ways that should be 
  transparent for FOCMEC package plot files.  Program sgfswap has been
  added; it swaps the byte order in the binary .sgf plot files.  The 
  write-up in the manual on graphics has been moved to Appendix D.
  Although the use of the FOCMEC search parameter worked, the description of
  it was incomplete and the printed output regarding it in Focmec runs
  was imprecise.  That has been corrected, and ANGLE has been added to the
  output of runs of Dsretc.  This can be useful when doing runs of Focmec
  with a single solution provided by an external source.  In the application
  within this package, it is for the CMT solution for the Sakhalin Island
  event.
  The discussion of the Sakhalin Island event example has bee expanded.  Now
  it shows explicitly how well (in this case) one can do with a sparse
  broadband network using S polarities and amplitude ratios.  Previously the
  showed only that the solution could be improved by adding the BB data to
  P-wave polarity data.
  The printer plots produced by program Dsretc did not work on some compilers.
  Adding a "save" to two subroutines fixed that.
  In Focplt, if one is adding solutions from a file after adding other
  solutions, there was no prompt to verify it was the correct file.  Now it
  does (changes in solplt.f).
  The command "make clean" in ./src now deletes all executables and libraries.
  Calls to symbol for actual symbols got warnings in f77.  No longer.
April 2009: The wording in prompts in program focplt have been modified
  to remove ambiguities about adding solutions to plots.  One can add
  several sets of solutions for the same set of focal mechanisms or different
  focal mechanisms to the same plot.  One answers yes to the prompt
  "Add more solutions to same plot?"
November 2008: If INFO was left out for a ratio, did not read line.
  Now it does.  In Oksol.f:  If both numerator and denominator are near the
  nodal surfaces (called N&D), the number of ratios is decreased by one.
  If the number of remaining ratios is not more than the number
  of bad ratios, the solution is classified as unacceptable.
August 2008: A code change in subroutine finrng.f of program remodl solved an 
  instability that occurred when using the Sun f95 compiler.
July 2008:  I have dropped SAC graphics to maximize portability.  
  Furthermore,  the way I had used SAC graphics was through a Fortran
  library last updated prior to 1994 (when SC2000 was introduced) 
  and is specific to only a couple of operating systems (Sun OS and
  some versions of Linux).  What is lost is the ability to edit plots
  online when running program focplt.  One can  still add labels, but
  only through iterations of runs such as those included in the 
  sample_runs sub_directories.  The system has been tested on Mac OS X
  (both PPC and i686), Linux, and Sun Solaris.  Two programs have been
  renamed: fileprep is now ratio_prep and fmecprep is now focmec_prep.
January 6, 2003: Plot files without needing the SAC graphics package:
  I have written and tested (on Sun Solaris only) a modified set of
  subroutines which can produce an SGF-format plot file without using
  the SAC library, and the executables will be more portable as they
  can be built with the -Bstatic switch.  Unlike the SAC routines, one
  gets only a disk file -- no terminal display.  The output file is
  still in the unformatted SGF format, but the conversion programs to
  postscript which are based on sgf2ps.c look like they should not be
  system dependent.  I will try to test this on PC/Linux, but have not
  done it as of this writing.  To use this feature, go to subroutine
  fmplotsub_nosac and enter "make" (no quotes).  To build program focplt,
  go to subdirectory src and enter "clp_nosac focplt" which should create
  a focplt binary and put it in subdirectory bin.  The scripts for running
  focplt must be modified as one is not asked for choices for the plot
  output (screen, named disk file, temp.sgf disk file) as the program is
  hard wired to create a disk file named temp.sgf.  
September 12, 2002:  The comment lines in fmecprep.f implied that files
  were read in the opposite order from the way they are so I fixed that.
  (the first file read in is the output from fileprep, the second is a
  stripped-down Focmec input file.  Also, in the Appendix in 
  focmec_manual.pdf describing the input polarity format, there were 
  questions about the directions which is hopefully cleared up with some 
  rewording.  The biggest problem comes from the fact that "C" stands for 
  "Compression" which means up on the vertical which in fact corresponds to 
  dilatation at the source.
September 10, 2002:  Corrected some typos in focmec_manual.pdf and added a
  "beachball" figure and discussion in Appendix B.
late July 2002:  I had not paid adequate attention to the problems of
  using SV polarities and amplitudes near or above the critical emergence
  angle.  I have added an appendix in focmec_manual.pdf and put in caveats in
  programs fmecprep and freesurf to address this.  The bottom line is
  that one should use SV near or above the critical angle only with
  great care.
5 July 2002: Some compilers do not like the way I had used
  CVALUE -- CVALUE(1:NFILE) with NFILE defined on the right-hand side.
  I also made other I/O routines less compiler dependent.
30 May 2002: Bug fix:  I had forgotten to modify a subroutine for program
  focplt (solplt.f) taking into account a change in subroutine fmreps.f
  made in March.  Only program focplt was affected.
March 2002: Emergent polarity picks can now be used in <i>Focmec</i> if the user
  so chooses.  Previously they could only be displayed in <i>Focplt</i> plots.
March 2002:  Added an option to program dsretc so that one could use
  moment-tensor input (CMT convention).  It is an adaptation of Bob
  Herrmann's programs mteig and mtdec.  Instead of using <i>Numerical
  Recipes</i> subroutine, I used the original <i>EISPACK</i> versions.
October 2001:  Code was changed slightly in several subroutines to increase
  compatibility among various compilers.
September 2001:  Using Microsoft Fortran 4.0 Powerstation, I was able to 
  create the unformatted sequential file iasp91.hed and direct access 
  iasp91.tbl which could then be read by a revised version of fileprepL.f.  
  (I found that the unformatted, sequential access file could be read only 
  by programs built using the same PC compiler as was used to create the 
  file.)  All this was done using Virtual PC v3 on a Mac G4 running OS9.)
August 2001: Alexey A. Lyubushin, Dr.Sci., United Institute of the Physics 
  of the Earth, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, created PC executables 
  of all but the plotting program focplt and program fileprep in the FOCMEC 
  programs.  The programs compiled and ran on both Digital Visual Fortran 
  under MS  Windows-98 and GNU g77 under PC Solaris 5.8.  These have not 
  been exhaustively tested.
3 August 2001: When building the fmsub library, one user reported that
  FOCMEC.INC was empty.  It had been a soft link to ../src/FOCMEC.INC.
  I replaced the link with a direct copy.
28 July 2001: Added source and (Solaris) executable for a program to
  create a Focmec input file from Hypoellipse output.  (hypo2foc)
21 July 2001: Program radiat wrote out the wrong SH sign convention
  as a comment to output.  Now it says positive is left, back to
  source (not station).  Only comment was wrong.  The radiation figure
  in Appendix B of focmec_manual.pdf had arrows pointing the wrong way for
  the SH polarity.  That has been fixed.  No code was affected.
26 May 2001: Some had problems with Fortran function value.f,
  so changed it slightly.  Also took out PARAMETER(tab,char(9))
  in two functions as that was not recognized by some compilers.
December 2000: The author no longer has a machine running sunos, so
  the executables for that platform will not be updated after this date.
April 2000: Replaced the examples from previous versions with two new
  examples: one for a P polarities only from a regionally recorded
  event in eastern Tennessee, and the other for the teleseismically
  recorded 1990 deep-focus Sakhalin Island deep-focus event.  These
  can be found in directory sample_runs.  This was part of a preparation
  of the package to appear as a subchapter in the IASPEI centennial
  handbook.
28 July 1998: For solaris 2 I had not been able to create or 
  overwrite plot files.  Found the problem: subroutine zopenc.c
  in the SAC library.  Not clear why it ever worked.  Patch is
  described in file sacfix.html.
27 July 1998: In test_runs/blaeqk.dat, the comments part of the
  entries for the ratios input data imply ratios that are not
  correct.  These are not used, but they are misleading.  The
  similar comments in test_runs/e393.dat are okay in that they
  lead to ratios which are consistent with the entries.
19 July 1997: Compiled/linked programs for solaris 2.5.1 (sun).
  Only changes required were in the compile-link scripts --
  leaving out the -Bstatic switch and, in ~/src/cl_plot_src,
  leaving out three plot libraries which do not exist in solaris 2.
  Used the sac solaris 2 library (gotten by ftp from LLNL).
27 February 1997: If numerator is near nodal surface, now returns
  correct sign in TOP.  Change is in subroutine lratio.f
7 January 1997: Corrected an error in lratio.f for solutions near a
  nodal surface for either the numerator or the denominator
  but not both.  Previously the ratio returned was not updated
  for such cases, so was what had been found in the previous call.
3 August 1993:  Changed rules for nodal surfaces with ratios.
  Now have separate CUTP and CUTS for lower bounds of radiation
  factors.  No more "FACTOR".  If numberator or denominator
  is near the nodal surface, use cutoff value when calculating
  ratio.  If both are near, still treat it as indeterminate and
  do not count towards error total.  Some changes in output format.
  See oksol.f for details.
20 June 1993:  Corrected an error in focinp.f which kept the option
  for separate P and S polarity error limits from working
  correctly.  Also put in a "belts and braces" addition so that
  if one use the V, H, or S key for ratios bu did not put in the
  S angle, it would not come out as zero.  Made cosmetic changes
  to a couple of other subroutines.
15 May 1992:  Corrected an error in OKSOL, changed name of
	listing file from lp.lst to focmec.lst
28 August 1991:  sun version including SV polarities and SV/SH ratios
9 July 1990:  Put in limits for the range of ratios to be tested to
  allow for near-nodal solutions.  Routines affected are FOCINP,
  OKSOL, OKRAT, LSPRAT, and FOCMEC.INC.  Also, took out the fancy
  calculating for 0/0 in ratios.  It's nice theoretically, but not
  for comparisons with data.  Also, took out Kisslinger's last-squares
  adjustment for the solution involving ratios as, as written, it
  did not take into account polarities and tended to confuse more
  than help.  In FOCPLT (the companion plotting program), the ratio
  ranges required a change in the input for SOLPLT.  PRPLOT also had
  cosmetic changes. 
22 February 1990:  Changed an2dsr, v2trpl, oksol to include "weird"
  cases correctly (although there were no errors before).  Replaced
  DPSTRK with AN2DSR in OKSOL.
COMMENTS UPDATE 16 OCTOBER 1989
Code was originally written in Fortran 77 for a PDP 11/34 operating
  under RSX version 4.1.  The version here is in Fortran 77 for
  a VAX (VMS)
In addition to the include file FOCMEC.INC, subroutines from two
  source libraries are used, FMLIB.OLB and GENSUB.OLB.  To build
  these libraries and to link FOCMEC along with the other programs
  in the package, use the command file BUILD.COM
Subroutines in GENSUB used in FOCMEC are BELL, CVALUE, IYESNO, LENC,
  PRINT, PRINTX, TIMDAT, TRUTH, and VALUE (entries RVALUE and IVALUE)
Subroutines in FMLIB used in FOCMEC are ANTPIN, AN2DSR, AN2MOM,
  DPSTRK, DSRIN, FLTSOL, FMLSQ, FMREPS, FOCINP, GMPRD, LSPRAT, 
  OKPOL, OKRAT, OKSOL, SRCHFM, STTIST, TA2XY, TRPL2V, and V2TRPL
Digital F77 routines include: SECNDS, OPEN, ASSIGN, CLOSE,
  TIME, DATE
END OF COMMENTS UPDATE 16 OCTOBER 1989
12 October 1989:  Cleaned up code to make a little less dependent
  on VAX.  The subroutines are now in three large files, FMLIB.FOR,
  GENSUB.FOR, and PLOTSUB.FOR.  FMLIB contains all subroutines which
  have little or no system dependence - including a large SYMBOL
  routine.  Not all subroutines are for FOCMEC, which has no
  plotting, for example.  The subroutines are for FMECPREP, FOCPLT,
  SOLSORT and SVPRAT as well.  GENSUB has some "primitives" which
  may have some system dependence.  One new feature here is that
  if the program is run from a command file, such as RUNFOCMEC.COM,
  one can put a comment on the same line as the entry if a tab is
  used as a delimiter or a space is used if the input is not
  character data.  The convention for defaults in prompted input is
  to use [] to enclose the entry.  Default means one responds with
  a carriage return from a terminal or a null entry or tab from a
  command file.  PLOTSUB contains my versions of PLOTS and PLOT,
  which, while calcomp compatible in calling arguments, are tailored
  to my personal conventions for disk file formats and a restricted
  set of terminals.  If your own plot library is linked BEFORE the
  other files, you should be able to use FOCPLT with little
  modification.  To build the programs, simply enter @BUILD.  The
  command file makes libraries and links all the programs.  If you
  want only a subset of the programs, you can edit BUILD.COM
  accordingly. 
2 September 1986:  Changed SRCHFM so that sort of focal sphere
  is more nearly equal area (thanks to Tim Long and Rick
  Williams for noting that it was not).  Also tried to
  make things more standard FORTRAN 77 by getting rid of
  BYTE variables and replacing READ and WRITE to unit 5
  with ACCEPT and TYPE.
10 June 1986:  in LSPRAT fixed case for when both numerator
  and denominator in S/P ratio are zero
16 January 1986:  Tidied up FOCINP.  Introduced the 
  interactive functions RVALUE and IVALUE, which are
  now entries in VALUE.
6 October 1985:  For the V and H S/P ratio input lines in
  FOCINP, added the S take-off angle as a separate entry.
  Previously just assumed it to be the same as the P angle.
  This results in a change in the input format so that old
  input files will not work.  The R format (simple SV input)
  remains unchanged.
27 September 1985:  Added a relative weighting option
  for polarities.  If chosen, the total number of error
  is entered as before but as a real variable and a
  threshold weight is asked for.  Each polarity error is
  weighted by the absolute value of the radiation factor
  or the threshold, whichever is larger.
12 August 1985:  Added option of a total number of polarity
  errors rather than simply choosing numbers of P and
  S errors separately.
  Increased COMMENT field for ratio input to 20 and
  changed format statements accordingly.
  Replaced a DO loop in FOCINP with a GOTO loop so that
  emergent polarities do not count against total possible.
27 JULY 1985:  Added SH polarity.  For the key one enters
  < r > (for left or right respectively) for first motion (back
  to event).  Also, added moment tensor representation to output in
  listing file  (Dziewonski & Woodhouse convention, unit
  scalar moment)
$ December 1984:  Eliminated double solutions when plunge
  of B is 0 degrees.  (Only allowed trend to vary
  between 0 and 180 degrees.  This could affect
  searches for small parts of the focal sphere.)
23 October 1984: Added the possibility for using SH
  amplitudes instead of only SV on the vertical.
  Also, if the input line key is V (for SV) or H
  (for SH), the program expects to find a polarity
  for the S and a comment following the log(ratio).
  Entering R for the key will work as before: assumes
  the ratio is for SV on vertical and there is no
  polarity or comment.  The output now includes the
  theoretical S polarity, but it does not use it in
  the search.  Another small change which only acts
  to speed up the search is that for a B axis plunge
  of 90 degrees there is only one trend tried.
  The SH amplitude case has not been checked yet.
