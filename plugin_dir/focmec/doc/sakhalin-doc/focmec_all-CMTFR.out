 197 P Pol.  8 SV Pol.  8 SH Pol. 50.0 allowed (weighted) errors
Threshold = 0.10
 Input 16 ratios 16 allowed errors, maximum error of 0.50    VP/VS = 1.830
For ratios,  0.050 = P radiation cutoff  0.150 = S radiation cutoff
 The minimum, increment and maximum B axis trend are   229.65    5.00  229.65

 The limits for the angle of the A axis are    15.10    5.00   15.10
 R Ac/Al is number of acceptable ratios / allowed
 RMS Err is the RMS of acceptable obs-calc ratios
 RMS Err (all) is the RMS of all obs-calc ratios
