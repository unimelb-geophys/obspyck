This package contains software for determining and displaying double-couple
earthquake focal mechanisms. Input are polarities (P, SV , SH) and amplitude
ratios (SV/P, SH/P, SV/SH). The main program, Focmec (coded in Fortran 77),
performs an efficient, systematic search of the focal sphere and reports
acceptable solutions based on selection criteria for the number of polarity
errors and errors in amplitude ratios. The search of the focal sphere is
uniform in angle, with selectable step size and bounds. The selection
criteria for both polarities and angles allow adjustment through weightings
for near-nodal solutions. Published applications include determinations of
best-constrained fault-plane solutions for suites of earthquakes recorded at
local to regional distances, analysis of large earthquakes observed at
teleseismic distances, and the use of recorded polarities and relative
amplitudes to produce waveform synthetics.

The fact that you are reading this file indicates that you have downloaded,
uncompressed, and expanded the source tarball focmec.tgz. Instructions for
building and testing the package are in HTML format.  One starts by opening
./doc/focmec.html.  Included among the links is one to the FOCMEC manual: 
./doc/focmec_manual.pdf.  Another link is to a list of updates, so you can see
what has been changed since the previous release.
