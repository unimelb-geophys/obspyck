The program sequence is ratio_prep, focmec_prep, focmec, focplt

Included in this directory are only the input files that do not come from
running an earlier program in the chain.  Output files from successful runs are
in ../../doc/sakhalin-doc -- it is suggested that one compare your results with
them..

There is one driver file for Ratio_prep

There are two driver files for Focmec_prep:  one brings in Q.

There are seven driver files for Focmec
   rfocmec_8staR      8 BB stations: relative error 0.5 SV
   rfocmec_neic       NEIC P polarity
   rfocmec_neicR      NEIC P polarity relative weighting
   rfocmec_all        NEIC P polarity plus 8 BB station
   rfocmec_allR       NEIC P polarity plus 8 BB station relative weighting
   rfocmec_all-neicF  All data fixed to the NEIC P polarity solution
   rfocmec_all-CMTFR   All data fixed to the CMT solution relative weighting

There are two driver files for Focplt:
   rfocplt_PNodal  P nodal planes for NEIC, BB, CMT solutons plus all data
   rfocplt_SV      SV nodal surfaces for BB (10), CMT, NEIC (1)

In preparing the CMT solution, program Dsretc was run for the three possible
input mechanism: two sets of dip, strike, slip plus trends and plunges
for P and T.  (The angles are given to the nearest integer, so the criterion
was to find the input set that gave the best consistency.)  Output, and the
DMC summary, are in ../../doc/sakhalin-doc.

File stations.loc is called by the script rration_prep_8sta

See the documentation for further discussion about these runs.
