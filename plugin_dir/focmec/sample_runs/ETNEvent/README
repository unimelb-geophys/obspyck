First one must run hypowfoc to convert the hypoellipse output file into 
a Focmec input file.  

.././.hypo2foc  Run interactively using the prompts.
   The input file is 8703270729.arc
   The output file is 8703270729.dat

Included are driver files for four runs of Focmec and two runs of Focplt.

   For Focmec, two files use 8703270729.dat as the input file:
   rfocmec (unity-weighint errors), and rfocmecR (relative weighting)
   The other two are to demonstrate the use of emergent P data, and the
   input file is test_emergence.dat.
   
   Input for the three Focplt runs use the output from one or the other
   from the first two Focmec runs as input.

Copies of successful output files, including the PDF version of plots, 
are in ../../doc/ETNEvent-doc/

Discussion of the runs are in the documentation.
